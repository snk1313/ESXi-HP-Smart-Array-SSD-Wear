# ESXi-HP-Smart-Array-SSD-Wear

Zabbix template to measure non-HP branded SSDs connected to HP Smart Array controller on servers running ESXi.

Tested on:

- HPE ProLiant G8, 9 and 10 series servers with HP branded RAID controllers (200 series not included).
- ESXi 7 and 8. Sure it will work on older versions of ESXi.
- Intel D3-S4510 Series, Samsung 870 EVO, Crucial MX500 series SATA SSDs.
